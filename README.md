This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Third party utilities && libraries that are used

- React Hook Form
- React Modal
- React Search Autocomplete
- Tailwind CSS

## What is missing and could be improved:

- Missing validation on EducationModal (name) (Not yet integrate with ReactHookForm with React Search Autocomplete)
- Better loader on auto suggest input
- Proper state management
- Strict validations especially on Dates inputs
- Left panel Bookmark (I dont quiet get the specification there)
- A better UI

## Deploy on Vercel
